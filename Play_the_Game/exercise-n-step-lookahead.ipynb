By definition, \"leaf nodes\" in a game tree are nodes that don't have nodes below them.\n\nIn the ConnectX competition, the game trees will be much larger!  \n\nTo see this, consider a minimax agent that is trying to plan its first move, where all columns in the game board are  empty.

Should we expect the minimax agent to still play the game well, despite the contradiction with its assumptions?

(You can see an example of how to write a valid agent in **[this notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/create-a-connectx-agent)**.)\n\nIf you decide to use the minimax code from the tutorial, you might like to add [**alpha-beta pruning**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) to decrease the computation time (i.e., get the minimax algorithm to run much faster!).  In this case, \"alpha\" and \"beta\" to refer to two values that are maintained while the algorithm is running, that help to identify early stopping conditions.  \n\nWithout alpha-beta pruning, minimax evaluates each leaf node.  With alpha-beta pruning, minimax only evaluates nodes that could provide information that affects the agent's choice of action.
